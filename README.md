# Python Blockchain with Flask

## Project Description

This project implements a basic blockchain in Python using the Flask framework. The development process closely follows the steps outlined in Daniel van Flymen's tutorial, which can be accessed [here](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of blockchain implementation. By following the tutorial, the focus is on hands-on learning and practical application to enhance comprehension of how blockchains function.

## Usage

The repository contains a conda enviroment to easily recreate the blockchain:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The flask server can be started by typing:

```
$ python src/sever.py
```

Postman can be used to access the end points of the application!
